# Metastatic-TNBC
This repository contains reconstructed metabolic models for generated 33 condition specific models that included four groups of healthy tissue (HT)-, metastatic tumor (TM)-, primary tumor (TP)-, and paired-adjacent normal tissue (NT)-specific models based on RNA-seq data

## Installation

### Required Software
* A functional MATLAB installation (MATLAB 7.3 and higher).
* The [RAVEN toolbox](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN).
* The [COBRA toolbox](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox) (necessary for ecGEM reconstruction).


### Dependencies - Recommended Software
* The libSBML MATLAB API (version [5.13.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/5.13.0/stable/MATLAB%20interface/) is recommended).
* [Gurobi Optimizer](http://www.gurobi.com/registration/download-reg) for any simulations.
